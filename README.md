# Express.js - Empty or Invalid JSON Request Body Handling

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Express.js applications where handling empty or invalid JSON request bodies leads to unexpected behavior.

## Bug Description

The Express.js application fails to gracefully handle empty or malformed JSON data sent in the request body.  When an empty request body or a request body that is not valid JSON is received, the application does not return an appropriate error response. This lack of error handling makes debugging and identifying the source of the problem challenging. 

## Solution

The solution involves implementing robust error handling and input validation to properly manage various scenarios.  This includes checking for empty request bodies and using try-catch blocks to handle potential JSON parsing errors.
